# Hi There!

![Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=dhiganthrao&color=blue&label=profile+views)

I'm Dhiganth, a 24 year old graduate student currently studying at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science! 

I'm really interested in trying to automate loads of tasks I do daily using the simplest scripts I can, and I'm proud to say that I've succeeded in doing so (only for a few tasks though xD).

## Experience

I am a Software Engineer (previously an Engineer Intern) at [Sema4.ai](https://sema4.ai) where I'm working on AI agents and architectures. Currently, I'm working on the agent server responsible for handling AI agents of different cognitive architectures and LLMs. It's super interesting and I can't wait to share more about it!

I was a Software Engineering Intern at [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/), where I tackled problems related to Deep Learning for Application Screen Testing and Statistical Analyses of User Metrics. I designed a Machine Learning Pipeline with an impressive 99% testing accuracy. This project honed my expertise in data analysis and pattern recognition, enabling me to turn data into actionable insights.

I was a Research Intern at the [Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kancheepuram](https://www.iiitdm.ac.in/), where I learnt how to efficiently apply Deep Learning to Medical Image Processing.

I was a Software Engineering Intern at [Activeloop](https://activeloop.ai), where I helped in rebuilding and maintaining an open source package named [Hub](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub); that lets you store (even petabyte-scale) datasets on the cloud, and lets you seamlessly integrate it with your ML applications! Don't waste time cleaning and preprocessing your data, use Hub instead.

I was also an Undergraduate Research Assistant at [Solarillion Foundation](https://solarillionfoundation.org/), where I worked on projects related to Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.

 üê¶ I developed a TwitterBot (written in Python) that tweets a list of hospitals based on the address pincode provided by the user. Check it out [here.](https://github.com/dhiganthrao/HospitalBot)

 üè® I also deployed a Python script and used Google's ChatBot API, [Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs), on multiple Raspberry Pi's for a hotel scanning system which generates a unique QR code to unlock the door to the room of the user. Check it out [here.](https://github.com/dhiganthrao/Make-A-Thon)

 üè´ Along with a few of my friends, I helped build an advanced (sort of) Python script that attends your online classes and answers very basic questions for you in your place! Check it out [here.](https://github.com/dhiganthrao/bunk_bot) (By the way, I am in no way responsible if someone does, in fact, use this to attend online classes. That's on them.)

 üë®üèª‚Äçüî¨ At Solarillion Foundation, my team and I have come up with a scalable, efficient model based on Transformer architectures to accurately translate German Sign Language into an output text sequence in German!

 ‚úàÔ∏è As part of my research in [Solarillion Foundation](https://github.com/solarillion), I built a two stage Machine Learning model to classify flights as delayed or not delayed, and to predict the time of delay (in minutes), if there was delay present. Check it out [here.](https://github.com/dhiganthrao/ML-Project)
