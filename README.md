# Hi There!

I'm Dhiganth, a 19 year old student currently studying at [SSN College of Engineering](https://www.ssn.edu.in/), Chennai. I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering, though my chief interests lie in programming. I'm also an Undergraduate Research Assistant at [Solarillion Foundation](https://solarillionfoundation.org/), where I'm currently working on projects related to Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. I really like coding and I'm experienced (slightly) in programming languages like Python, C++ and Java, to name a few.  

I'm really interested in trying to automate loads of tasks I do daily using the simplest scripts I can, and I'm proud to say that I've succeeded in doing so (only for a few tasks though xD).

## Projects

 üê¶ I recently developed a TwitterBot (written in Python) that tweets a list of hospitals based on the address pincode provided by the user. Check it out [here.](https://github.com/dhiganthrao/HospitalBot)

 üè® I also deployed a Python script and used Google's ChatBot API, [Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs), on multiple Raspberry Pi's for a hotel scanning system which generates a unique QR code to unlock the door to the room of the user. Check it out [here.](https://github.com/dhiganthrao/Make-A-Thon)

 üè´ Along with a few of my friends, I helped build an advanced (sort of) Python script that attends your online classes and answers very basic questions for you in your place! Check it out [here.](https://github.com/dhiganthrao/bunk_bot) (By the way, I am in no way responsible if someone does, in fact, use this to attend online classes. That's on them.)

 ‚úàÔ∏è As part of my research in [Solarillion Foundation](https://github.com/solarillion), I built a two stage Machine Learning model to classify flights as delayed or not delayed, and to predict the time of delay (in minutes), if there was delay present. Check it out [here.](https://github.com/dhiganthrao/ML-Project)

 ü§ñ I'm currently working on a Discord Bot named Zeus. It's nearly done, so stay tuned!
